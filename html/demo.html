        hiyy &nbsp; <br>
        I don’t know if people remember how they learned to read and write—or swim, or do cartwheels.
        I know that one day I wasn’t able to do these things, and the next day I was, even though the difficult gray area in between perhaps extended for months,
        years even. And the day I did suddenly know how to read and write was so different from all the rest behind me, 
        <br> 
        that it seems perhaps more reasonable now to believe that I never was that other person—that I never existed in a world without letters.
        But of course we all did live in such a world at one time,
        even if trying to recall it is as unnatural as jumping into the shallow end of the pool and pretending you can’t swim.
